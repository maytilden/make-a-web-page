<h1><b>INTRO TO PROGRAMMING: GETTING STARTED WITH THE WEB AND HTML</b></h1><br>
<h2><b>Lesson 1: Web Fundamentals</b></h2>
<div class=header>What is HTML?</div>
<div class= "concept-description"> 
  <p>HTML is the main type of document/content on the web. HTML stands for Hyptertext Markup Language. HTML is made up of <i>text content</i>, which is what you see, and <i>mark up</i>, which is what that content looks like. When a person uses his or her browser to go to a webpage, that webpage is sending a HTTP request to a server. That server in turn finds the HTML doc and sends it back to the user's browser. The web browser then interprets this HTML.</p>
</div>

<div class=header> The Essentials: Tags and Elements</div>
  <div class=concept-description>
    <p>HTML is made up of elements. Tags are then used to define these elements. An attribute is an element modifier. The anchor attribute is utilized to form links within elements. Inline</i> tags differ from <i>block tags</i> because block tags form an invisible box around the content inside of them.</p>
</div>
<h2><b>LESSON 2:FRONT END WEB DEVELOPMENT AND CREATING A STRUCTURED DOCUMENT WITH HTML</b></h2>
<div class=header> HTML and CSS are both languages</div>
  <div class= concept-description>
    <p>Both HTML and CSS are languages with both syntax and rules. HTML defines structure and content. A good analogy for HTML would be that is acts like the foundation of a house. CSS works to control the style of the page. You can compare it to the interior decoration of a house. CSS dictates such things as pixels and font sizes.</p></div>
<div class=header>DOM: The "tree-like structure" of HTML </div>
<div class=concept-description>
  <p><b>DOM</i></b> stands for Document Object Model. This refers to the treelike structure of a page, which is made up of HTML elements. Elements can essentially branch off from one another, keeping in mind there is an origin "branch."
<p>The "treelike" structure results in elements of webpages showing up like boxes within one another. All wesbites made up of boxes, which helps in restructuring a page if necessary as it helps make different parts of a page interchangeable.</p></div>
  <h3><b>LESSON 3: How CSS Interacts with HTML</b></h3>
<div class=header>The Basics of CSS</div>
<div class=concept-description><p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The idea of inheritance is essential to understanding how CSS works in that descendent elements inherit CCSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them. In general though, box related propertes are not inherited. Inheritance is important also because is prevents certain properties from being declared over and over again in a style sheet<p></div>
<div class=header>How to Add CSS to HTML</div>
<div class=concept-description><p>There are 3 methods that can be utilized to add CSS to a webpage:
  <p>1. Write the CSS code in the head of your HTML</p>
  <p>2. Link HTML to a separate CSS file; Have a .html and .css files in the same folder</p>
  <p>3. Write your style inline with you HTML. Not suggested as this leads to repetition </p></div>
<div class=header>The Box Method</div>
<div class=concept-description><p>With every box on a page there is a margin, border, padding, and concent. The content is the image or text in the center. Box size can be set in both pixels or percentages. Percentage is screen size dependent, which usually makes for a better user experience.</p></div>
